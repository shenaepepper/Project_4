# Project_4

This was the hardest project I have ever had to do this group didnt work well together. 
No one liased with eachother.

I dont even know where the final presentaion was added or where the final code was added either. Isabellla was supposed to download to her github I cant see where it is anywhere I also cant find how to add th epresentation as it has a ock on it where only the group members can see. 

I msgd the group many times and noone got back to me hence why I have uploaded the project late. It was very stressful.

I have never had troubles like this where there was no communication with any other group before. I really hope this doesnt effect my grades. 

I also spend hours trying to work out how to make the code work propery and I figured it out tod the group and they just ignored and didnt add it to the original code so that it wokred so I have uploaded the original coed and then a draft I did with the changes to show it does now work. I also dont know how to  upload the data because will was supposed to put the data on a SQL base so not sure where that is I have just been using images and I cant downoad every image to github as there is thousands. 

I have uploaded what I coud maybe see where isabella and will upload there project from.

So sorry I feel like this is such a mess.
We did complete and present it I am just not sure where the final project is and no one is responding to me and isablla had the main github we were supposed to al use and she hasnt uploaded anything
